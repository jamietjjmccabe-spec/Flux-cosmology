# Flux Cosmology & Quantum Coherence Model
### Author: Jamie McCabe

This repository contains the research code and paper associated with a new 
closed-flux cosmology model, incorporating:

- A flux scalar field driving cosmic acceleration
- A unified BH–disk–jet feedback system
- A lunar orbital simulation including flux-modified gravity
- Cosmological evolution with entropy/flux coupling
- Figures and numerical predictions

The objective is open scientific access: the code is MIT licensed, and the 
paper is licensed under CC-BY 4.0. Anyone may run, verify, or extend the 
models, provided attribution is given.
